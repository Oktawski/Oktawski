ðŸ”­ What do I know? I know .Net (WebAPI, EntityFramework, MVC, Blazor), Kotlin (Room, Coroutines, rxJava), Java (but not as much as some time ago, now I am full time .Net enthusiast)
ðŸ”­ What am I learning? React is my go to frontend library. I am able to make fullstack apps with MVC and Blazor, now it's time to learn something serious.


Iâ€™m currently working on Password Manager app (.Net API + React Frontend) and SmartHome project that consists of Spring Server, Android application communicating with that server and Arduino devices controlled via said server.
