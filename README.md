:keyboard: What do I know? 
- .Net (RestAPI, EntityFramework, MVC, Blazor, Authorization, Microsoft Graph API, XUnit)
- Kotlin (Room, Coroutines, rxJava)
- Java (Spring, but not as much as some time ago, now I am full time .Net enthusiast)


:book: What am I learning? 
- React is my go to frontend library. I am able to make fullstack apps with MVC and Blazor, now it's time to learn something serious


:magic_wand: What is my biggest power?
- I can solve almost any problem with the use of C#. There is no "it can't be done" in my vocabulary


Iâ€™m currently working on Password Manager app (.Net API + React Frontend) and SmartHome project that consists of Spring Server, Android application communicating with that server and Arduino devices controlled via said server.
