:keyboard: What do I know? 
- .Net (RestAPI, EntityFramework, MVC, Blazor, Authorization, Microsoft Graph API, xUnit)
- Kotlin (Room, Coroutines, rxJava)
- Java (Spring, but not as much as some time ago, now I am full time .Net enthusiast)


:book: What am I learning? 
- React is my go to frontend library that I have to know better but I can still use it to create frontend apps communicating with APIs


:magic_wand: What is my biggest power?
- I am creative and my favourite tool is C#. There is no "it can't be done" in my vocabulary


Iâ€™m currently working on Password Manager app (.Net API + React Frontend) and SmartHome project that consists of Spring Server, Android application communicating with that server and Arduino devices controlled via said server.
